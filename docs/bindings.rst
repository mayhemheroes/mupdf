Overview
========


Auto-generated C++, Python and C# versions of the MuPDF C API are available.

These APIs are currently a beta release and liable to change.

The C++ MuPDF API
=================

* Auto-generated from the MuPDF C API's header files.

* Everything is in C++ namespace `mupdf`.

* Provides C++ functions that wrap most `fz_*()` and `pdf_*()` functions.

  * Functions and methods do not take `fz_context`
    arguments. (Automatically-generated per-thread contexts are used internally.)

  * MuPDF `setjmp()`/`longjmp()`-based exceptions are converted into C++ exceptions.

* Provides C++ classes that wrap most `fz_*` and `pdf_*` structs.

  * These C++ wrapper classes automatically handle reference counting of the
    underlying C structs. So there is no need for manual calls to `fz_keep_*()`
    and `fz_drop_*()`, and class instances can be treated as values and copied
    arbitrarily.

  * Class methods provide access to most of the underlying C API.

* Provides a small number of extensions beyond the basic C API:

  * Some generated classes have extra  `begin()` and `end()` methods to allow standard C++ iteration:
    |expand_begin|
    ::
        #include "mupdf/classes.h"
        #include "mupdf/functions.h"

        #include <iostream>

        void show_stext(mupdf::StextPage& page)
        {
            for (mupdf::StextPage::iterator it_page: page)
            {
                mupdf::StextBlock block = *it_page;
                for (mupdf::StextBlock::iterator it_block: block)
                {
                    mupdf::StextLine line = *it_block;
                    for (mupdf::StextLine::iterator it_line: line)
                    {
                        mupdf::StextChar stextchar = *it_line;
                        fz_stext_char* c = stextchar.m_internal;
                        using namespace mupdf;
                        std::cout << "StextChar("
                                << "c=" << c->c
                                << " color=" << c->color
                                << " origin=" << c->origin
                                << " quad=" << c->quad
                                << " size=" << c->size
                                << " font_name=" << c->font->name
                                << "\n";
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    |expand_end|

  * Some custom class methods and constructors.

  * Functions for generating a text representation of some simple 'POD' structs.

    For example for `fz_rect` we provide these functions::

        std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& out, const fz_rect& rhs);
        std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& out, const Rect& rhs);
        std::string to_string_fz_rect(const fz_rect& s);
        std::string to_string(const fz_rect& s);
        std::string Rect::to_string() const;

    These each generate text such as: `(x0=90.51 y0=160.65 x1=501.39 y1=1215.6)`

The Python and C# MuPDF APIs
============================

* A python module called `mupdf`.
* A C# namespace called `mupdf`.

  * C# bindings are experimental as of 2021-10-14.
* Generated from the C++ MuPDF API's header files, so inherit the abstractions of the C++ API:

  * No `fz_context` arguments.
  * Automatic reference counting, so no need to call `fz_keep_*()` or `fz_drop_*()`, and we have value-semantics for class instances.
  * Native Python and C# exceptions.
* Output parameters are returned as tuples.
* Allows implementation of mutool in Python - see `mupdf:scripts/mutool.py <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=mupdf.git;a=blob;f=mupdf:scripts/mutool.py>`_
  and `mupdf:scripts/mutool_draw.py <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=mupdf.git;a=blob;f=mupdf:scripts/mutool_draw.py>`_.

* Provides text representation of simple 'POD' structs::

    rect = mupdf.Rect(...)
    print(rect) # Will output text such as: (x0=90.51 y0=160.65 x1=501.39 y1=215.6)

  * This works for classes where the C++ API defines a `to_string()` method as described above.

    * Python classes will have a `__str__()` method.
    * C# classes will have a `ToString()` method.

* Uses SWIG Director classes to allow C function pointers in MuPDF structs to call Python code.

  * This has not been tested on C#.

Installing the Python mupdf module using `pip`
==============================================

The Python `mupdf` module is available on the `Python Package Index (PyPI) website <https://pypi.org/>`_.

* Install with: `pip install mupdf`
* Pre-built Wheels (binary Python packages) are provided for Windows and Linux.
* For more information on the latest release, see changelog below and: https://pypi.org/project/mupdf/

Doxygen/Pydoc API documentation
===============================

Auto-generated documentation for the C, C++ and Python APIs is available at:
https://ghostscript.com/~julian/mupdf-bindings/

* All content is generated from the comments in MuPDF header files.

* This documentation is generated from an internal development tree, so may
  contain features that are not yet publicly available.

* It is updated only intermittently.

Example client code
===================

Using the Python API
--------------------

Minimal Python code that uses the `mupdf` module::

    import mupdf
    document = mupdf.Document('foo.pdf')

A simple example Python test script (run by `scripts/mupdfwrap.py -t`) is:

* `scripts/mupdfwrap_test.py <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=mupdf.git;a=blob;f=scripts/mupdfwrap_test.py>`_

More detailed usage of the Python API can be found in:

* `scripts/mutool.py <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=mupdf.git;a=blob;f=scripts/mutool.py>`_
* `scripts/mutool_draw.py <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=mupdf.git;a=blob;f=scripts/mutool_draw.py>`_


**Example Python code that shows all available information about a document's Stext blocks, lines and characters.**

        '''
        for p in range(document.count_pages()):
            page = document.load_page(p)
            stextpage = mupdf.StextPage(page, mupdf.StextOptions())
            for block in stextpage:
                block_ = block.m_internal

  Details
  |expand_begin|

  * Use SWIG Director classes to support MuPDF structs that contain fn
    pointers. This allows MuPDF to call Python callback code. [.line-through]#Only
    available on Unix at the moment.#

    * This allows us to provide Python wrappers for `fz_set_warning_callback()`
      and `fz_set_error_callback()`.

  * Added alternative wrappers for MuPDF functions in the form of free-standing
    functions that operate on our wrapper classes. Useful when porting existing
    code to Python, and generally as a non-class-based API that still gives
    automatic handling of reference counting. New functions have same name as
    underlying MuPDF function with a `m` prefix; they do not take a `fz_context`
    arg and take/return references to wrapper classes instead of pointers to MuPDF
    structs.

    * Class methods now call these new free-standing wrappers.

  * Various improvements to enums and non-copyable class wrappers.

  * Use `/** ... */` comments in generated code so visible to Doxygen.

  * Improvements to and fixes to reference counting.

    * Use MuPDF naming conventions for detection of MuPDF functions that return
      borrowed references.

    * Improved detection of whether a MuPDF struct uses reference counting.

    * Fixed some reference counting issues when handling out-params.

  * Added optional runtime ref count checking.

  * For fns that return raw unsigned char array, provide C++ wrappers that
    return a `std::vector<unsigned char>`. This works much better with SWIG.

  * Allow construction of `Document` from `PdfDocument`.

  * Allow writes to `PdfWriteOptions::opwd_utf8` and
    `PdfWriteOptions::upwd_utf8`.

  * Added `Page::doc()` to return wrapper for `.doc` member.

  * Added `PdfPage::super()` to return `Page` wrapper for `.super`.

  * Added `PdfDocument::doc()` to return wrapper for `.doc` member.

  * Added `PdfObj::obj()` to return wrapper for `.obj` member.

  * Made Python wrappers for `fz_fill_text()` take Python tuple/list for `float*
    color` arg.

  * Improved wrapping of `pdf_lexbuf`.

  * Added `Page` downcast constructor from `PdfPage`.

  * Expose `pdf_widget_type` enum.

  * Improved python bindings for `*dict_getl()` and `*dict_putl()`. We now also
    provide `mpdf_dict_getl()` etc handling variable number of args.

  * Improvements to wrapping of `pdf_filter_options`, `pdf_redact_options`,
    `fz_pixmap`, `pdf_set_annot_color`, `pdf_obj`.

  * Allow direct use of `PDF_ENUM_NAME_*` enums as `PdfObj`'s in Python.

  * Added wrappers for `pdf_annot_type()` and `pdf_string_from_annot_type()`.

  * `Buffer.buffer_storage()` raises an exception with useful error info (it is
    not possible to use it from SWIG bindings).

  * Added various fns to give Python access to some raw pointer values, e.g. for
    passing to `mupdf.new_buffer_from_copied_data()`.

  * Avoid excluding class method wrappers for `pdf_*()` fns in python.
  |expand_end|

* **2022-02-05**: Uploaded Doxygen/Pydoc documentation for the C, C++ and Python
  APIs, from latest development tree.

* **2021-09-29**: Released Python bindings for **mupdf-1.19.0** (git 61b63d734a7)
  to pypi.org (**mupdf 1.19.0.20210929.1226**) with pre-built Wheels for Windows
  and Linux.

* **2021-08-05**: Released Python package **mupdf-1.18.0.20210805.1716** on
  pypi.org with pre-built Wheels for Windows and Linux.

  * Improved constructors of `fz_document_writer` wrapper class
    `DocumentWriter`.

  * Fixed `operator<<` for POD C structs - moved from `mupdf` namespace to
    top-level.

  * Added `scripts/mupdfwrap_gui.py` - a simple demo Python PDF viewer.

  * Cope with `fz_paint_shade()`'s new `fz_shade_color_cache **cache` arg.

* **2021-05-21**: First release of Python package, **mupdf-1.18.0.20210521.1738**,
  on pypi.org with pre-built Wheels for Windows and Linux.

  Details
  |expand_begin|
  * Changes that apply to both C++ and Python bindings:

    * Improved access to metadata - added `Document::lookup_metadata()`
      overload that returns a `std::string`. Also provided `extern const
      std::vector<std::string> metadata_keys;` containing a list of the supported
      keys.

    * Iterating over `Outline`'s now returns `OutlineIterator` objects so that
      depth information is also available.

    * Fixed a reference-counting bug in iterators.

    * `Page::search_page()` now returns a `std::vector<Quad>`.

    * `PdfDocument` now has a default constructor which uses
      `pdf_create_document()`.

    * Include wrappers for functions that return `fz_outline*`, e.g. `Outline
      Document::load_outline();`.

    * Removed potentially slow call of `getenv("MUPDF_trace")` in every C++
      wrapper function.

    * Removed special-case naming of wrappers for `fz_run_page()` - they are now
      called `mupdf::run_page()` and `mupdf::Page::run_page()`, not `mupdf::run()`
      etc.

    * Added text representation of POD structs.

    * Added support for 32 and 64-bit Windows.
    * Many improvements to C++ and Python code generation.

  * Changes that apply only to Python:

    * Improved handling of out-parameters:

      * If a function or method has out-parameters we now systematically return a
        Python tuple containing any return value followed by the out-parameters.

      * Don't treat `FILE*` or pointer-to-const as an out-parameter.

    * Added methods for getting the content of a `mupdf.Buffer` as a Python
      `bytes` instance.

    * Added Python access to nested unions in `fz_stext_block` wrapper class
      `mupdf.StextBlock`.

    * Allow the MuPDF Python bindings to be installed with `pip`.

      * This uses a source distribution of mupdf that has been uploaded to
        `pypi.org` in the normal way.

      * Installation involves compiling the C, C++ and Python bindings so will
        take a few minutes. It requires SWIG to be installed.

      * Pre-built wheels are not currently provided.

    * Write generated C++ information into Python pickle files to allow building
      on systems without clang-python.

    * Various changes to allow building in Python "Manylinux" containers.

    * Allow Python access to nested unions in `fz_stext_block` wrapper. SWIG
      doesn't handle nested unions so instead we provide accessor methods in our
      generated C++ class.

    * Added accessors to `fz_image`'s wrapper class.

    * Improved generated accessor methods - e.g. ignore functions and function
      pointers and return `int` instead of `int8_t` to avoid SWIG getting confused.
  |expand_end|

* **2020-10-07**: Experimental release of C++ and Python bindings in MuPDF-1.18.0.


Building the C++, Python and C# MuPDF APIs
==========================================

Setup
-----

General requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Linux, Windows or OpenBSD.

* Python development libraries.

* Python package `libclang` - a Python interface onto the libclang C/C++ parser.

* SWIG version 3 or 4.


Windows
^^^^^^^

Install Python using the Python Windows installer from the python.org website:

* http://www.python.org/downloads

Notes about other Python installers:

* Don't use other installers such as the Microsoft Store Python package.

* If Microsoft Store Python is already installed, leave it in place and install
  from python.org on top of it - uninstalling before running the python.org
  installer has been known to cause problems.

Installing with the Python Windows installer from python.org:

* A default installation is sufficient.

* If "Customize Installation" is chosen, make sure to include "py launcher" so
  that the `py` command will be available.

* Also see: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html

Other:

* Run: `pip install libclang`

* We look for `devenv.com` in some hard-coded locations, which can be overriden
  with:

  * `scripts/mupdfwrap.py -b --devenv <devenv.com-location> ...`

* Run `scripts/mupdfwrap.py` with `--swig-windows-auto` so that we
  automatically download swig to local directory if not already present, and use
  it directly.


Linux
^^^^^

(Debian-specific; similar packages exist on other distributions.)

* `sudo apt install python3-dev swig python-clang`

Notes:

* One can do `pip install libclang` instead of installing the `python-clang`
  package in the above command.

* `pip install clang` does not provide a usable Python interface onto the clang
  parser.


OpenBSD
^^^^^^^

* `sudo pkg_add python py3-llvm swig`


Doing a build
-------------

Build MuPDF shared library, C++ and Python MuPDF APIs, and run basic tests::

    git clone --recursive git://git.ghostscript.com/mupdf.git
    cd mupdf
    ./scripts/mupdfwrap.py -b all --test-python
    ./scripts/mupdfwrap.py -b all --test-python-gui

As above but do a debug build::

    ./scripts/mupdfwrap.py -d build/shared-debug -b all --test-python

C# build and tests::

    ./scripts/mupdfwrap.py -b --csharp all --test-csharp
    ./scripts/mupdfwrap.py -b --csharp all --test-csharp-gui

For more information:

* Run `./scripts/mupdfwrap.py -h`.
* Read the doc-string at beginning of `+scripts/wrap/__main__.py+`.

How building the APIs works
---------------------------

Building the MuPDF shared library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* On Unix, runs `make` on MuPDF's Makefile.
* On Windows, runs `devenv.com` on `.sln` and `.vcxproj` files within `platform/win32/ <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=mupdf.git;a=tree;f=platform/win32>`_.

Generation of the C++ MuPDF API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Uses clang-python to parse MuPDF's C API.

* Generates C++ code that wraps the basic C interface, converting MuPDF
  `setjmp()`/`longjmp()` exceptions into C++ exceptions and automatically
  handling ``fz_context``'s internally.

* Generates C++ classes for each `fz_*` and `pdf_*` struct, and uses various
  heuristics to define constructors, methods and static methods that call
  `fz_*()` and `pdf_*()` functions. These classes' constructors and destructors
  automatically handle reference counting so class instances can be copied
  arbitrarily.

* C header file comments are copied into the generated C++ header files.

* Compile and link the generated C++ code to create shared libraries.


Generation of the Python and C# MuPDF APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Uses SWIG to parse the previously-generated C++ headers and generate C++,
  Python and C# code.

* Defines some custom-written Python and C# functions and methods, e.g. so that
  out-params are returned as tuples.

* If SWIG is version 4+, C++ comments are converted into Python doc-comments.

* Compile and link the SWIG-generated C++ code to create shared libraries.


Building auto-generated MuPDF API documentation
-----------------------------------------------

Build HTML documentation for the C, C++ and Python APIs (using Doxygen and pydoc)::

    ./scripts/mupdfwrap.py --doc all

This will generate the following tree::

    mupdf/docs/generated/
        index.html
        c/
        c++/
        python/

All content is ultimately generated from the MuPDF C header file comments.

As of 2022-2-5, it looks like `swig -doxygen` (swig-4.02) ignores single-line `/** ... */` comments, so the generated Python code (and hence also Pydoc documentation) is missing information.

Generated files
---------------

File required at runtime are created in `mupdf/build/shared-<build>/`.

Other intermediate generated files are created in `mupdf/platform/`

C++ bindings details
====================

Class-based API overview
------------------------

Class wrappers are defined for each MuPDF struct.

* These classes are defined in: `mupdf/platform/c++/include/mupdf/classes.h`

MuPDF functions that take a pointer to a MuPDF struct as their first arg
(ignoring any initial `fz_context*` arg), are usually available as a method of
the corresponding wrapper class.

Args that are pointers to a MuPDF struct will be changed to take a reference to
the corresponding wrapper class.

In addition there will be a non-member function called `mupdf::m<fnname>()`
which provides exactly the same functionality, taking a reference to the
wrapper class as an explicit first arg called `self`.

* These non-member functions are declared in:
  `mupdf/platform/c++/include/mupdf/classes2.h`


Details
^^^^^^^

* Class wrappers for a MuPDF struct `fz_bar` are called `mupdf::Bar`.

* Class wrappers for a MuPDF struct `pdf_bar` are called `mupdf::PdfBar`.

* All C++ functions omit any `fz_context*` arg.

* All C++ functions convert MuPDF exceptions into C++ exceptions.


Wrapper functions
-----------------

Wrappers for a MuPDF function `fz_foo()` are available in multiple forms:

* Functions in the `mupdf` namespace.

  * `mupdf::foo()`

    * Low-level wrapper:

      * Does not take `fz_context*` args.
      * Translates MuPDF exceptions into C++ exceptions.
      * Takes/returns pointers to MuPDF structs.
      * Code that uses these functions will need to make explicit calls to
        `fz_keep_*()` and `fz_drop_*()`.

  * `mupdf::mfz_foo()`

    * High-level wrapper:

      * Does not take `fz_context*` args.
      * Translates MuPDF exceptions into C++ exceptions.
      * Takes references to C++ wrapper class instances instead of pointers to
        MuPDF structs.
      * Where applicable, returns a C++ wrapper class instance instead of a
        pointer to a MuPDF struct.
      * Code that uses these functions does not need to call `fz_keep_*()`
        and `fz_drop_*()` - C++ wrapper class instances take care of reference
        counting internally.

* Class methods

  * Where `fz_foo()` has a first arg (ignoring any `fz_context*` arg) that
    takes a pointer to a MuPDF struct `foo_bar`, it is generally available as a
    member function of the wrapper class `mupdf::FooBar`:

    * `mupdf::FooBar::foo()`

  * Apart from being a member function, this is identical to
    `mupdf::mfz_foo()`, for example taking references to wrapper classes
    instead of pointers to MuPDF structs.


POD Wrapper classes
-------------------

Class wrappers for MuPDF structs default to having a `m_internal` member which
points to an instance of the wrapped struct. This works well for MuPDF structs
which support reference counting, because we can automatically create copy
constructors, `operator=` functions and destructors that call the associated
`fz_keep_*()` and `fz_drop_*()` functions.

However where a MuPDF struct does not support reference counting and contains
simple data, it is not safe to copy a pointer to the struct, so the class
wrapper will be a POD class. This is done in one of two ways:

* `m_internal` is an instance of the MuPDF struct, not a pointer.

  * Sometimes we provide members that give direct access to fields in
    `m_internal`.

* An 'inline' POD - there is no `m_internal` member; instead the wrapper class
  contains the same members as the MuPDF struct. This can be a little more
  convenient to use.



Wrapper class constructors
--------------------------

Wrapper class constructors are created for each MuPDF function that returns an
instance of a MuPDF struct.

Sometimes two such functions do not have different arg types so C++
overloading cannot distinguish between them as constructors (because C++
constructors do not have names).

We cope with this in two ways:

* Create a static method that returns a new instance of the wrapper class
  by value.

  * This is not possible if the underlying MuPDF struct is not reference counted
    or trivially copyable.

* Define an enum within the wrapper class, and provide a constructor that takes
  an instance of this enum to specify which MuPDF function to use.


Wrapper class default constructors
----------------------------------

Some POD classes have a default constructor that sets the various fields to
default values.

Where it is useful, non-POD wrapper classes can have a default constructor that
sets `m_internal` to null.


Extra static methods
--------------------

Where relevant, wrapper class can have static methods that wrap selected MuPDF
functions. For example `Matrix` does this for `fz_concat()`, `fz_scale()` etc,
because these return the result by value rather than modifying a `fz_matrix`
instance.


Miscellaneous custom wrapper classes
------------------------------------

The wrapper for `fz_outline_item` does not contain a `fz_outline_item` by
value or pointer. Instead it defines C++-style member equivalents to
``fz_outline_item``'s fields, to simplify usage from C++ and Python/C#.

The fields are initialised from a `fz_outline_item` when the wrapper class
is constructed. In this particular case there is no need to hold on to a
`fz_outline_item`, and the use of `std::string` ensures that value semantics
can work.


Python/C# bindings details
==========================

Custom methods for use by Python/C# bindings
--------------------------------------------

Python and C# code does not easily handle functions that return raw data, for example
as an `unsigned char*` that is not a zero-terminated string. Sometimes we provide a
C++ method that returns a `std::vector` by value, so that Python and C# code can
wrap it in a systematic way.

For example `Md5::md5_final2()`.


Making MuPDF function pointers call Python code
-----------------------------------------------

For MuPDF structs with function pointers, we provide a second C++ wrapper
class for use by the Python bindings.

Limitations:

* Problems have been seen on Windows when using these callbacks.

Description:

* The second wrapper class has a `2` suffix, for example `PdfFilterOptions2`.

* This second wrapper class has a virtual method for each function pointer, so
  it can be used as a `SWIG Director class <https://swig.org/Doc4.0/SWIGDocumentation.html#SWIGPlus_target_language_callbacks>`_.

* Overriding a virtual method in Python results in the Python method being
  called when MuPDF C code calls the corresponding function pointer.

* One needs to activate the use of a Python method as a callback by calling the
  special method `use_virtual_<method-name>()`. [It might be possible in future
  to remove the need to do this.]

* It may be possible to use similar techniques in C# but this has not been
  tested.

These Python callbacks have args that are more low-level than in the rest of
the Python API:

* Callbacks generally have a first arg that is a SWIG representation of a MuPDF
  `fz_context*`.

  * This is provided so that callbacks are able to call MuPDF C function
    pointers (which generally take a `fz_context *ctx` arg).

  * However as of 2022-06-03 if the C function throws a MuPDF exception, it
    will not be translated into a C++/Python exception, and so probably crash the
    process.

* Where the underlying MuPDF function pointer has an arg that is a pointer to
  an MuPDF struct, unlike elsewhere in the MuPDF bindings we do not translate
  this into an instance of the corresponding wrapper class. Instead Python
  callbacks will see a SWIG representation of the low-level C pointer.

  * It is not safe to construct a Python wrapper class instance directly from
    such a SWIG representation of a C pointer, because it will break MuPDF's
    reference counting - Python/C++ constructors that take a raw pointer to a
    MuPDF struct do not call `fz_keep_*()` but the corresponding Python/C++
    destructor will call `fz_drop_*()`.

  * It might be safe to create an wrapper class instance using an explicit call
    to `mupdf.keep_*()`, but this has not been tested.

Here is an example PDF filter written in Python that removes alternating items:

::
    import mupdf

    def test_filter(path):
        class MyFilter( mupdf.PdfFilterOptions2):
            def __init__( self):
                super().__init__()
                self.use_virtual_text_filter()
                self.recurse = 1
                self.sanitize = 1
                self.state = 1
                self.ascii = True
            def text_filter( self, ctx, ucsbuf, ucslen, trm, ctm, bbox):
                print( f'text_filter(): ctx={ctx} ucsbuf={ucsbuf} ucslen={ucslen} trm={trm} ctm={ctm} bbox={bbox}')
                # Remove every other item.
                self.state = 1 - self.state
                return self.state

        filter_ = MyFilter()

        document = mupdf.PdfDocument(path)
        for p in range(document.count_pages()):
            page = document.load_page(p)
            print( f'Running document.filter_page_contents on page {p}')
            document.begin_operation('test filter')
            document.filter_page_contents(page, filter_)
            document.end_operation()

        document.save_document('foo.pdf', mupdf.PdfWriteOptions())
